consider subscribing I want you to know that then please consider leaving a like and let's get right into this guide if
you're finding it when you're watching a video on YouTube the video is not full screen even though it should be and then
it's like small in the top or the side of your screen then let me show you how you can fix this first you just closed
off the video like so and also this is going to go and apply to pretty much all type of the TVs and devices as well like
Amazon Fire Sticks and Rockers it's all going to apply and literally what we need to do is go and fully restart the
device with a TV or a device plugged into the TV to do that what you need to do is you can just put power off if you
like it doesn't really matter so he could just power off like that but after that isn't going to do everything because
this is usually like a sleep mode and what you need to do is go to the plug so here is the plug for my device here so
all I'm going to do is go completely unplug it like that for about 10 seconds just to make sure that it completely sort
of powers off and there's no power remaining in it and so now I'm going to go and plug it back in as 10 seconds have
passed and then what you can do is go and turn your device back on if it doesn't turn on automatically and then go back
to YouTube and go and see if the issue has been resolved as it should be if it hasn't and what you can do is try
uninstalling YouTube from your TV and then downloading it and installing it again in order to go and uninstall an app
that will worry a little bit depending on what device for using but this guy should apply I'm personally using a fire
stick if you're wondering so firstly just go to your home screen so I'd go and tap on the home button in my case and
what I'll do is go to my device settings so that will bring a little bit to do that on a fire stick just go to the far
right and tap on settings and go down and then go across the applications like so scroll down to manage installed
applications and then this is show you all the apps on your TV and what we need to do is go and locate YouTube so scroll
down just like so and here it is what we need a bottle because it's why it's there and what you can do is tap on it and
what you can do is press audio store like so and I can go and this Choice and then that's going to go and install it and
then what I can do is go and read it from the App Store and so then I'll go across and go and find the app store just
like so and here it is App Store and I'll just go and search for YouTube it shouldn't take too long at all this is the
one I want I'll tap on it and then I'll go and tap on down download on the left and side just like so and it's now
finished down loading and it's now installing so then we'll go and open up and the issue should be able to tap on open
like so as you can see it's not opening as I said before restarting your TV should go and fix the problem so there we go
guys I hope this did work for you if it did please go down below and leaving a like piece
